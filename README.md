## [Alpine-Kanboard][234]
#### Container for Alpine Linux + PHP7 + Kanboard
---

This [image][233] containerizes [Kanboard][137] kanban webapp and
the background worker using [Beanstalk][140] along with its php
dependencies to track tasks for a peson or small group.
**Database not included**. Checkout [alpine-mysql][139] to
configure your own MySQL server in a container.

Based on [Alpine Linux][131] from [alpine-php][132] image with
[NGINX][135], [PHP7][136] and the [s6][133] init system
[overlayed][134] in it.

**Auto updated according to the [Github][138] release**

Updated with latest php7 packages and proxied out through NGINX,
which can be also used to serve the static files.

The image is tagged respectively for the following architectures,
* **armhf**
* **x86_64** (retagged as the `latest` )

**armhf** builds have embedded binfmt_misc support and contain the
[qemu-user-static][105] binary that allows for running it also inside
an x64 environment that has it.

---
#### Get the Image
---

Pull the image for your architecture it's already available from
Docker Hub.

```
# make pull
docker pull woahbase/alpine-kanboard:x86_64
```

---
#### Configuration Defaults
---

* Kanboard is located at the endpoint `/kanboard/`, with the
  webapp at `/config/www/kanboard/`. If using the SQLite3
  database, mount `/config/www/kanboard/data` and optionally
  `/config/www/kanboard/plugins` for persistence.

* Kanboard source is located at `/opt/kanboard/kanboard.zip`.

* Beanstalk and the worker are started by default and the worker
  uses the configuration from `/config/www/kanboard/config.php` to
  connect.

* Daily cronjob in enabled.

* These configurations are inherited from the nginx image:

    * Drop privileges to `alpine` whenever configured to. Respects
      `PUID` / `PGID`.

    * Binds to both http(80) and https(443). Publish whichever you
      need, or both.

    * Default configs setup a static site at `/` by copying
      `/defaults/index.html` at the webroot location
      `/config/www/`.  Mount the `/config/` locally to persist
      modifications (or your webapps). NGINX configs are at
      `/config/nginx`, and vhosts at `/config/nginx/site-confs/`.

    * 4096bit Self-signed SSL certificate is generated in first
      run at `/config/keys`. Pass the runtime variable
      `SSLSUBJECT` with a valid info string to make your own.

    * `.htpasswd` is generated with default credentials
      `admin/insecurebydefault` at `/config/keys/.htpasswd`

    * Sets up a https and auth protected web location at `/secure`.

    * If you're proxying multiple containers at the same host, or
      reverse proxying multiple hosts at the same container, you
      may need to add `--net=host` and/or add entries in your
      firewall to allow traffic.

---
#### Run
---

If you want to run images for other architectures, you will need
to have binfmt support configured for your machine. [**multiarch**][104],
has made it easy for us containing that into a docker container.

```
# make regbinfmt
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Without the above, you can still run the image that is made for your
architecture, e.g for an x86_64 machine..

Running `make` starts the service.

```
# make
docker run --rm -it \
  --name docker_kanboard --hostname kanboard \
  -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000 \
  -c 256 -m 256m \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v config:/config \
  -v /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  woahbase/alpine-kanboard:x86_64
```

Stop the container with a timeout, (defaults to 2 seconds)

```
# make stop
docker stop -t 2 docker_kanboard
```

Removes the container, (always better to stop it first and `-f`
only when needed most)

```
# make rm
docker rm -f docker_kanboard
```

Restart the container with

```
# make restart
docker restart docker_kanboard
```

---
#### Shell access
---

Get a shell inside a already running container,

```
# make shell
docker exec -it docker_kanboard /bin/bash
```

set user or login as root,

```
# make rshell
docker exec -u root -it docker_kanboard /bin/bash
```

To check logs of a running container in real time

```
# make logs
docker logs -f docker_kanboard
```

---
### Development
---

If you have the repository access, you can clone and
build the image yourself for your own system, and can push after.

---
#### Setup
---

Before you clone the [repo][231], you must have [Git][101], [GNU make][102],
and [Docker][103] setup on the machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/woahbase/alpine-kanboard
cd alpine-kanboard
```
You can always skip installing **make** but you will have to
type the whole docker commands then instead of using the sweet
make targets.

---
#### Build
---

You need to have binfmt_misc configured in your system to be able
to build images for other architectures.

Otherwise to locally build the image for your system.
[`ARCH` defaults to `x86_64`, need to be explicit when building
for other architectures.]

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 build
# sets up binfmt if not x86_64
docker build --rm --compress --force-rm \
  --no-cache=true --pull \
  -f ./Dockerfile_x86_64 \
  --build-arg ARCH=x86_64 \
  --build-arg DOCKERSRC=alpine-php \
  --build-arg PGID=1000 \
  --build-arg PUID=1000 \
  --build-arg USERNAME=woahbase \
  -t woahbase/alpine-kanboard:x86_64 \
  .
```

To check if its working..

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 test
docker run --rm -it \
  --name docker_kanboard --hostname kanboard \
  -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000 \
  woahbase/alpine-kanboard:x86_64 \
  sh -ec 'nginx -v; php --version; echo "$(cat /opt/kanboard/version)";'
```

And finally, if you have push access,

```
# make ARCH=x86_64 push
docker push woahbase/alpine-kanboard:x86_64
```
